# Ontology mappings used during normalization.
#
# The structure is intentionally lightweight so it can be expanded without
# changing application code. Each entity type contains a list of concepts with
# their identifiers, preferred labels, ontology provider, and optional synonyms.
#
# Providers document where the identifiers originate from. The `provider` field
# in each entity entry should reference one of these keys.

We therefore did a multiple-treatments meta-analysis, which accounts for both direct and indirect comparisons, to assess the e/uniFB00  ects of 12 new-generation antidepressants on major depression.\n\nMethods We  systematically  reviewed  117  randomised  controlled  trials  (25 928  participants)  from  1991  up  to Nov 30, 2007, which compared any of the following antidepressants at therapeutic dose range for the acute treatment of  unipolar major depression in adults: bupropion, citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, fl  uoxetine, fl  uvoxamine, milnacipran, mirtazapine, paroxetine, reboxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine. The main outcomes were the proportion of patients who responded to or dropped out of the allocated treatment. Analysis was done on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nFindings Mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline were signifi  cantly more e/uniFB03 cacious than duloxetine (odds  ratios  [OR]  1\u00b739,  1\u00b733,  1\u00b730  and  1\u00b727,  respectively),  fl  uoxetine  (1\u00b737,  1\u00b732,  1\u00b728,  and  1\u00b725,  respectively), fl  uvoxamine  (1\u00b741,  1\u00b735,  1\u00b730,  and  1\u00b727,  respectively),  paroxetine  (1\u00b735,  1\u00b730,  1\u00b727,  and  1\u00b722,  respectively),  and reboxetine (2\u00b703, 1\u00b795, 1\u00b789, and 1\u00b785, respectively). Reboxetine was signifi  cantly less e/uniFB03 cacious than all the other antidepressants tested. Escitalopram and sertraline showed the best profi  le of acceptability, leading to signifi  cantly fewer discontinuations than did duloxetine, fl  uvoxamine, paroxetine, reboxetine, and venlafaxine.\n\nInterpretation Clinically important di/uniFB00  erences exist between commonly prescribed antidepressants for both e/uniFB03 cacy and acceptability in favour of escitalopram and sertraline. Sertraline might be the best choice when starting treatment for  moderate  to  severe  major  depression  in  adults  because  it  has  the  most  favourable  balance  between  benefi  ts, acceptability, and acquisition cost.\n\nFunding None.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn  the  past  20  years,  several  new  drugs  have  been introduced  for  the  treatment  of  depression,  many  of which are structurally related and share similar putative mechanisms of action. As with statins for the prevention of coronary events, 1 the extent to which these agents vary in terms of e/uniFB03 cacy and acceptability is unclear. Moreover, some of the new drugs are so-called me-too drugs 2 -ie, chemically similar to existing drugs with expiring patents rather  than  genuine  advances  in  treatment.  Systematic reviews  have  already  highlighted  some  di/uniFB00  erences  in e/uniFB03 cacy between second-generation antidepressants. 3-9\n\nWe  report  an  overview  of  all  randomised  controlled trials  that  compared 12 new-generation antidepressants in terms of e/uniFB03 cacy and acceptability in the acute-phase treatment of major depression. We used multiple-treatments  meta-analysis, 10 also  known  as  mixed-treatment comparisons  meta-analysis  or  network  meta-analysis, which allows the integration of data from direct (when treatments are compared within a randomised trial) and indirect  comparisons  (when  treatments  are  compared between trials by combining results on how e/uniFB00  ective they are  compared with a common comparator treatment). 11 We aimed to provide a clinically useful summary of the results of the multiple-treatments meta-analysis that can be used to guide treatment decisions.\n\n## Methods\n\n## Study selection and data collection\n\nAt  the  beginning  of  this  project,  we  drafted  a  study protocol and subsequently made it freely available to the public  on  our  institutional  website  before  carrying  out the fi  nal analyses. Furthermore, with the publication of this  paper  the  overall  data  set  will  be  in  the  public domain.\n\nFor our analysis, we included only randomised controlled trials that compared any of the following 12 new-generation antidepressants (bupropion, citalo  pram, duloxetine, escitalopram, fl  uoxetine, fl  uvoxamine, milnacipran, mirtazapine, paroxetine, reboxetine, sertra  line, and venlafaxine) as  monotherapy  in  the  acute-phase  treatment  of  adults with  unipolar  major  depression.  We  excluded  placebo groups where present and randomised controlled trials of women with post-partum depres  sion. 12\n\nTo  identify the relevant  studies,  we  reviewed  the Cochrane collaboration depression, anxiety, and neurosis review  group  controlled  trials  registers  (CCDANDTRstudies and CCDANCTR-references) up to Nov 30, 2007 .\n\nWe asked pharmaceutical companies, regulatory agencies, and study investigators to supply all available information.\n\nTwo persons within the reviewing team independently reviewed references and abstracts retrieved by the search, assessed the completeness  of  data abstraction,  and confi  rmed  quality  rating.  We  used  a  structured  dataabstraction  form  to  ensure  consistency  of  appraisal  for each  study.  Investigators  were  contacted  and  asked  to provide data to supplement the incomplete reporting of the original articles.\n\nWe gave studies a quality rating of adequate, unclear, or inadequate,  according  to  the  adequacy  of  the  random allocation concealment and blinding. 13 Studies that scored adequate  or  unclear  on  these  criteria  were  included  in the fi  nal list.\n\n## Outcome measures\n\nWe  defi  ned  acute  treatment  as  8-week  treatment  for both e/uniFB03 cacy and acceptability analyses. 14 If 8-week data were not available, we used data ranging between 6 and 12 weeks (we gave preference to the timepoint given in the original study as the study endpoint). Response and dropout rates were chosen as primary outcomes, being the most consistently reported estimates of acute-treatment  e/uniFB03 cacy  and  acceptability.  We  defi  ned response  as  the  proportion  of  patients  who  had  a reduction of at least 50% from the baseline score on the Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS) or Montgomery-\u00c5sberg depression rating scale (MADRS), or who scored much improved or very much improved on  the  clinical  global  impression  (CGI)  at  8  weeks. When trials reported results from all three rating scales, we used the HDRS results. Finally, we defi  ned treatment discontinuation (acceptability) as the number of patients who terminated the study early for any reason during the fi  rst 8 weeks of treatment (dropouts).\n\n## Comparability of dosages\n\nIn addition to internal and external validity, we assessed the comparability of dosages. Because we could not fi  nd any clear defi  nitions about equivalence of dosages among new-generation antidepressants in the published literature,  we  used  a  modifi  ed  version  of  a  previously published  classifi  cation  described  by  Gartlehner  and colleagues 8 (table  1).  We  employed  this  information  to detect inequalities in dosing that could a/uniFB00  ect comparative e/uniFB03 cacy, and used it in a sensitivity analysis by defi  ning within the therapeutic dose only those studies that used comparable dosages within the predefi  ned range.\n\n## Statistical analysis\n\nWe chose a dichotomous primary outcome mainly for clinical reasons. We used both the number of patients who  responded  and  the  number  of  patients  who dropped out to have hard outcome measures of both treatment e/uniFB03 cacy and acceptability. We used response rate instead of a continuous symptom score for e/uniFB03 cacy analysis to make the interpretation of results easier for clinicians. 15 When  dichotomous  e/uniFB03 cacy outcomes were  not reported, but baseline scores,  endpoint means, and standard deviations (SD) of the depression rating scales (such as  HDRS  or  MADRS)  were provided, we estimated the number of patients responding to treatment at 8 weeks (range 6-12 weeks)\n\nFigure 1: Study selection process\n\n|              | Range (mg/day)   | Low    | Medium       | High    |\n|--------------|------------------|--------|--------------|---------|\n| Bupropion    | 150-450          | <337\u00b75 | 337\u00b75-412\u00b75  | >412\u00b75  |\n| Citalopram   | 20-60            | <30    | 30-50        | >50     |\n| Duloxetine   | 60-100           | <70    | 70-90        | >90     |\n| Escitalopram | 10-30            | <15    | 15-25        | >25     |\n| Fluoxetine   | 20-60            | <30    | 30-50        | >50     |\n| Fluvoxamine  | 50-300           | <75    | 75-125       | >125    |\n| Milnacipran  | 50-300           | <75    | 75-125       | >125    |\n| Mirtazapine  | 15-45            | <22\u00b75  | 22\u00b75-37\u00b75    | >37\u00b75   |\n| Paroxetine   | 20-60            | <30    | 30-50        | >50     |\n| Reboxetine   | 4-12             | <5     | 5-9          | >9      |\n| Sertraline   | 50-200           | <75    | 75-125       | >125    |\n| Venlafaxine  | 75-250           | <156\u00b73 | 156\u00b725-218\u00b77 | >218\u00b775 |\n\n*117 randomised controlled trials correspond to 236 arms because two three-arm studies comparing fl  uoxetine with paroxetine and sertraline were included in this multiple-treatments meta-analysis.\n\n|              | Number of trials   | Year of publication   | Year of publication   | Year of publication   | Country   | Country       | Country   | Country   | Country            |\n|--------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|-----------|--------------------|\n|              |                    | Earliest              | Median                | Latest                | Europe    | North America | Africa    | Asia      | Multiple countries |\n| Bupropion    | 14                 | 1991                  | 2003                  | 2007                  | 1         | 10            | 0         | 0         | 2                  |\n| Citalopram   | 16                 | 1993                  | 2002                  | 2007                  | 4         | 4             | 0         | 1         | 4                  |\n| Duloxetine   | 8                  | 2002                  | 2006                  | 2007                  | 2         | 5             | 0         | 0         | 1                  |\n| Escitalopram | 19                 | 2000                  | 2005                  | 2007                  | 5         | 11            | 0         | 0         | 2                  |\n| Fluoxetine   | 54                 | 1991                  | 2000                  | 2007                  | 15        | 13            | 1         | 3         | 6                  |\n| Fluvoxamine  | 11                 | 1993                  | 1998                  | 2006                  | 3         | 2             | 0         | 1         | 2                  |\n| Milnacipran  | 6                  | 1994                  | 2000                  | 2003                  | 2         | 1             | 0         | 2         | 0                  |\n| Mirtazapine  | 13                 | 1997                  | 2002                  | 2005                  | 3         | 3             | 1         | 1         | 5                  |\n| Paroxetine   | 32                 | 1993                  | 2001                  | 2007                  | 12        | 13            | 1         | 1         | 2                  |\n| Reboxetine   | 8                  | 1997                  | 2003                  | 2006                  | 2         | 2             | 0         | 0         | 1                  |\n| Sertraline   | 27                 | 1993                  | 2000                  | 2007                  | 10        | 9             | 0         | 2         | 1                  |\n| Venlafaxine  | 28                 | 1994                  | 2002                  | 2007                  | 7         | 5             | 0         | 1         | 6                  |\n\nThe number of studies across countries in this table does not match the number of trials included in the review.

The network of eligible comparisons for acceptability (dropout rate) analysis is similar.\n\nwith  a  validated  imputation  method. 16 Responders  to treatment  were  calculated  on  an  intention-to-treat basis:  the  analysis  was  based  on  the  total  number  of randomly  assigned  participants,  irrespective  of  how the  original  study  investigators  analysed  the  data.  To carry out a clinically sound  analysis,  we  used  a conservative approach and imputed outcomes for the missing participants assuming  that they did not respond to treatment.\n\nFirst, we did pair-wise meta-analyses by synthesising 17 studies  that  compared  the  same  interventions  with  a random-e/uniFB00  ects  model 18 to  incorporate  the  assumption that  di/uniFB00  erent  studies  assessed  di/uniFB00  erent,  yet  related, treatment  e/uniFB00  ects. 17 We  used  visual  inspection  of  the forest  plots  to  investigate  the  possibility  of  statistical heterogeneity, and the I 2 statistic. 19 We did the analyses using Stata version 9.\n\nSecond,  we  did  a  random-e/uniFB00  ects  model  within  a Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in WinBUGS (MRC Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge, UK). 11 We modelled the binary outcomes in every treatment group of every study, and specifi  ed the relations  among  the  odds  ratios  (ORs)  across  studies making di/uniFB00  erent comparisons. 10 This method combines direct  and  indirect  evidence  for  any  given  pair  of treatments.  We  used  p  values  less  than  0\u00b705  and 95% CIs (according to whether the CI included the null value) to assess signifi  cance, and looked at a plausible range for the magnitude of the population di/uniFB00  erence. 20 We also assessed the probability that each antidepressant drug was the most e/uniFB03 cacious regimen, the second best, the third best, and so on, by calculating the OR for each drug  compared  with  an  arbitrary  common  control group, and counting the proportion of iterations of the Markov chain in which each drug had the highest OR, the second highest, and so on. We ranked treatments in terms of acceptability with the same methods.\n\nA key assumption behind multiple-treatments metaanalysis  is  that  the  analysed  network  is  coherent-ie, that direct and indirect evidence on the same comparisons do not disagree beyond chance. To estimate  incoherence,  we  calculated  the  ratio  of  odds ratios  for  indirect  versus  direct  evidence  whenever indirect  estimates  could  be  constructed  with  a  single common  comparator.  We  defi  ned  incoherence  as  the disagreement between direct and indirect evidence with a 95% CI excluding 1.\n\nFinally, we looked at comparative e/uniFB03 cacy among the 12  antidepressant  drugs.  We  expressed  these  using fl   uoxetine  as  reference  drug,  because  it  was  the  fi  rst among  these  12  antidepressants  to  be  marketed  in Europe and the USA, and it has been consistently used as reference drug among the di/uniFB00  erent pair-wise comparisons.\n\nWe did sensitivity analyses according to the following variables: dose (including only studies within the therapeutic  range)  and  imputation  (including  only studies without imputation). To investigate the e/uniFB00  ect of sponsorship  on  outcome  estimate,  we  carried  out  a meta-regression analysis.\n\n## Role of the funding source\n\nNo  drug  manufacturing  company  was  involved  in  the study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, writing of the report, or in the decision to submit the report for publication.

We  excluded  172  reports  that  did  not  meet eligibility criteria (fi  gure 1).  We  identifi  ed  a  further 15 unpublished trials eligible for our meta-analysis from pharmaceutical industry websites. Overall, we  used 117 trials from 1991 to 2007 for the multiple-treatments meta-analysis. 21-137 Most trials  (63%) were carried out in North America and Europe (table 2). Overall, 25 928 individuals were randomly assigned to one of the 12 antidepressant drugs and  were  included in the multiple-treatments  meta-analysis.

Most trials were rated as unclear  according  to  our  quality  assessment  and  only 12 were rated as adequate. Figure 2 shows the network of eligible comparisons for the multiple-treatments meta-analysis. Of the 66 possible pair-wise comparisons between the 12 treatments, 42 have been studied directly in one or more trials for e/uniFB03 cacy and 41 for acceptability.\n\nWe did direct comparisons (table 3), showing that e/uniFB03 cacy favours  escitalopram  over  citalopram;  citalopram  over reboxetine  and  paroxetine;  mirtazapine  over  fl  uoxetine and venlafaxine; sertraline over fl  uoxetine; and venlafaxine over fl  uoxetine and fl  uvoxamine. These results arise from 42 independent analyses without adjustment for multiple testing (ie, about two CIs would be expected to exclude 1 by chance alone). For dropouts, fl  uoxetine was better tolerated than reboxetine, and citalopram than sertraline.\n\nOverall, heterogeneity was moderate, although for most comparisons  the  95%  CI  included  values  that  showed very high  or no  heterogeneity, refl  ecting the  small number of included studies for each pair-wise comparison. In the meta-analyses of direct comparisons, we found I 2 values higher than 75% for the comparisons citalopram and reboxetine ( I 2 =85\u00b70%), and escitalopram and fl  uoxetine ( I 2 =82\u00b77%). In both cases, only two studies were included in the meta-analysis.\n\nFigure  3  summarises  the  results  of  the  multipletreatments  meta-analysis.  Escitalopram,  mirtazapine, sertraline, and  venlafaxine were  signifi  cantly  more e/uniFB03 cacious  than  duloxetine,  fl  uoxetine, fl   uvoxamine, paroxetine,  and  reboxetine  (even  though  less  clear benefi  ts were noted with sertraline than with escitalopram, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine when comparing with duloxetine  and  fl  uvoxamine,  with  the credibility interval for OR  slightly more than 1). Reboxetine was signifi  cantly less e/uniFB03 cacious than all the other  11  antidepressants.  These  fi  ndings  arise  from 66 simultaneous comparisons and about three statistically  signifi  cant  fi  ndings  might  be  expected  by chance alone. In terms of acceptability, duloxetine and paroxetine  were  less  well  tolerated  than  escitalopram and  sertraline;  fl  uvoxamine  less  well  tolerated  than citalopram,  escitalopram,  and  sertraline;  venlafaxine less  well  tolerated  than  escitalopram;  reboxetine  less well tolerated than many other antidepressants, such as bupropion,  citalopram,  escitalopram,  fl  uoxetine,  and sertraline; and escitalopram and sertraline were better tolerated than duloxetine, fl  uvoxamine, paroxetine, and reboxetine (fi  gure 3).\n\nMirtazapine,  escitalopram,  venlafaxine,  and  sertraline

Data  extraction and data entering were correct, and we could not identify any important variable that di/uniFB00  ered across comparisons in those loops; however, the number of included studies was small.\n\nExclusion of studies with any treatment dosage outside the defi  ned therapeutic range and without imputed data resulted in 109 and 90 trials, respectively. The multiple-treatments  meta-analysis  model  was  refi  tted accordingly  and  no  di/uniFB00  erences  in  conclusions  were observed in either set of ORs.\n\nFigure 4 shows the distribution of probabilities of each treatment being ranked at each of the possible 12 positions. Mirtazapine,  escitalopram,  venlafaxine, and  sertraline were among the most e/uniFB03 cacious treatments, and escitalopram, sertraline, bupropion, and citalopram were better tolerated than the other remaining antidepressants (fi  gure  4).  The  cumulative  probabilities  of  being  among the  four  most  e/uniFB03 cacious treatments  were:  mirtazapine (24\u00b74%), escitalopram (23\u00b77%), venlafaxine (22\u00b73%), sertraline (20\u00b73%), citalopram (3\u00b74%), milnacipran (2\u00b77%), bupropion (2\u00b70%), duloxetine (0\u00b79%), fl  uvoxamine (0\u00b77%), paroxetine (0\u00b71%), fl  uoxetine (0\u00b70%), and reboxetine (0\u00b70%). The cumulative probabilities of being among the four best treatments in terms of acceptability were: escitalopram (27\u00b76%), sertraline (21\u00b73%), bupropion (19\u00b73%), citalopram (18\u00b77%), milnacipran (7\u00b71%), mirtazapine (4\u00b74%), fl  uoxetine (3\u00b74%), venlafaxine (0\u00b79%), duloxetine (0\u00b77%), fl  uvoxamine (0\u00b74%), paroxetine (0\u00b72%), and reboxetine (0\u00b71%).\n\nIn  a  meta-regression  analysis  to  assess  potential sponsorship  bias,  ORs  and  fi  nal  rankings  did  not substantially  change.  The  cumulative  probability  of being among the four best treatments became slightly smaller for those drugs in trials which were sponsored by  the  marketing  company,  with  the  comparators moving up the ranking slightly.\n\n## Discussion\n\nOur analysis was based on 117 studies including 25 928  individuals  randomly  assigned  to  12  di/uniFB00  erent new-generation  antidepressants.  Our  fi  ndings  might help  to  choose  among  new-generation  antidepressants for acute treatment of major depression. Some antidepressants di/uniFB00  ered  both  statistically  and  clinically. In terms of response, mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine,  and  sertraline  were  more  e/uniFB03 cacious  than duloxetine, fl  uoxetine, fl  uvoxamine, paroxetine, and reboxetine. In terms of acceptability, escitalopram, sertraline, citalopram, and bupropion were better tolerated  than  other  new-generation  antidepressants. These  results  indicate  that  two  of  the  most  e/uniFB03 cacious treatments (mirtazapine and venlafaxine) might not be the best for overall acceptability.\n\nHere, we did not investigate important outcomes, such as  side-e/uniFB00  ects,  toxic  e/uniFB00  ects,  discontinuation  symptoms, and  social  functioning.  However,  the  most  important clinical implication of the results is that escitalopram and sertr  aline  might  be  the  best  choice  when  starting  a treatment for moderate to severe major depression because  they  have  the  best  possible  balance  between e/uniFB03 cacy and acceptability.\n\nWe  did  not  do  a  formal  cost-e/uniFB00  ectiveness  analysis; however, because some new anti  depressants are now o/uniFB00 patent  and  available  in  generic  form,  their  acquisition cost is reduced. Indeed, only two of the 12 antidepressants (escitalopram  and  duloxetine)  are  still  on  patent  in  the USA and in Europe. Sertraline seems to be better than escitalo  pram because of its lower cost in most countries. How  ever, in the absence of a full economic model, this recom  mendation cannot be made unequivocally because several other costs are associated with the use of antidepressants. 138\n\nReboxetine,  fl  uvoxamine,  paroxetine,  and  duloxetine were the least e/uniFB03 cacious and acceptable drugs, making them less favour  able options when prescribing an acute treat  ment for major depression. Furthermore, in terms of acceptability,  reboxetine  was  the  least  tolerated  agent among the 12 anti  depressants and was signifi  cantly less e/uniFB00  ective than all the other 11 drugs. Therefore, reboxetine should not be used as a routine fi  rst-line acute treatment for major depression.\n\nFindings from this analysis apply only to acute-phase treatment  (8  weeks)  of  depression.  Clinicians  need  to\n\nFigure 4: Ranking for effi cacy (solid line) and acceptability (dotted line) Ranking indicates the probability to be the best treatment, the second best, the third best, and so on, among the 12 antidepressants.\n\nknow  whether  (and  to  what  extent)  treatments  work within a clinically reasonable period. Clinically, the assessment of e/uniFB03 cacy after 6 weeks of treatment or after 16-24 weeks or more might lead to wide di/uniFB00  erences in treatment  outcome.  In  many  systematic  reviews,  the ability  to  provide  valid  estimates  of  treatment  e/uniFB00  ect  is limited because trials with di/uniFB00  erent durations of follow-up have been combined. 139 A systematic review of clinical-trial data 140 that investigated early response to antidepressants employed a common defi  nition of early response across all  included studies. Apart from this study, however, no systematic review has investigated the comparative e/uniFB03 cacy  of  antidepressants  in  individuals  with  major depression  employing  a  common  defi  nition  of  acute response that includes a predefi  ned follow-up duration.\n\nMost  trials  included  in  our  analysis  did  not  report adequate information about randomisation and allocation concealment,  and  this  might  undermine  the  validity  of overall  fi  ndings.  Nonetheless,  all  studies  on  antidepressants included in this meta-analysis were very similar in terms of design and conduct, and the scant information in terms of quality assessment could be more an issue of reporting in the text than real defects in study design, as it has been commonly found in other systematic reviews. 141\n\nEvidence exists of presence of sponsorship bias (ie, the bias associated with the commercial interests of industrial sponsors) in medicine, 142 and there is concern about the potential e/uniFB00  ect of fi  nancial interests on medical publications. Because most studies comparing the newest antidepressants (mirtazapine, escitalopram, buproprion, and duloxetine) were done by the pharmaceutical companies marketing these compounds, this  might  be  a  source  of  bias. 143 Some  discrepancies existed between some of the results of the multiple-treatments meta-analysis and  those in the direct  comparisons  (escitalopram vs citalopram  and mirtazapine vs venlafaxine). These fi  ndings emphasise a potential  advantage  of  this  analysis  that  incorporates indirect and direct comparisons, decreasing the risk for possible  sponsorship  bias.  However,  limitations  of  the primary trials and potential confounders (such as dose issues)  can  a/uniFB00  ect  the  validity  of  the  fi  ndings.  Readers cannot fully appreciate the meaning of a study without acknowledging the biases in the design and interpretation that can arise when a sponsor might benefi  t from a study publication. 144 Such associations should be made clear to let anyone judge the relevance of fi  ndings.\n\nPlacebo-controlled  trials  are  required  to  adequately assess  the  e/uniFB03 cacy  of  novel  antidepressant  drugs. 145 In both the USA and Europe, regulatory authorities require placebo-controlled  studies  for  marketing  authorisation. The selective publication of placebo-controlled antidepressant trials and its e/uniFB00  ect on apparent e/uniFB03 cacy is well  recognised 146 and  there  is  currently  controversy  on this topic 147 Placebo-controlled trials are mainly designed for  regulatory  approval  purposes;  to  meet  both  ethical and  safety  requirements,  they  tend  to  recruit  patients with a mild form of disease. 148 Although placebo-controlled trials can be e/uniFB03 cient because they need smaller sample sizes  than  non-placebo-controlled  trials,  di/uniFB03 culties  in carrying  out  these  trials  when  e/uniFB00  ective  treatments  are known  to  exist  can  introduce  artifacts into clinical trials. 149\n\nResponse  to  placebo  across  antidepressant  trials  has been shown to vary and has clearly increased in the past two  decades,  with  a  similar  increase  occurring  in  the fraction  of  patients  responding  to  active  medication  as well. 150 The issue of changes in trial outcomes over time is still  under  debate; 151 however,  the  change  in  placebo response does not seem to be directly explained by changes in study characteristics. 150 Infl  ation of baseline severity, for example, is likely to be a cause for the temporal rise in placebo response rates, which increases the proportion of failed  trials. 150 As  placebo-controlled  trials  of  antidepressants become increasingly di/uniFB03 cult to do, it is perhaps time to reconsider the standard requirements. Our analysis suggests that sertraline is better than other new-generation drugs in terms of e/uniFB03 cacy and acceptability, and could be used as a standard comparator in phase III and also in pragmatic (or e/uniFB00  ectiveness) trials to increase the real-world applicability  of  the  results.  Although  the  sample-size requirements might be larger than in the ideal placebo-controlled trial, the increased real-world applicability  of  the  results  would,  in  our  opinion,  o/uniFB00  set this disadvantage. Furthermore, the need of new treatments to show either greater e/uniFB03 cacy or acceptability than  an  existing  standard  therapy  would  serve  as  a disincentive  to  the  development  of  me-too  agents  that o/uniFB00  er little to patients other than increased costs.\n\n## Contributors\n\nAC, CB, TAF, RC, and JRG conceived and designed the meta-analysis, and GS and JPTH provided supervision.

We therefore did a multiple-treatments meta-analysis, which accounts for both direct and indirect comparisons, to assess the e/uniFB00  ects of 12 new-generation antidepressants on major depression.\n\nMethods We  systematically  reviewed  117  randomised  controlled  trials  (25 928  participants)  from  1991  up  to Nov 30, 2007, which compared any of the following antidepressants at therapeutic dose range for the acute treatment of  unipolar major depression in adults: bupropion, citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, fl  uoxetine, fl  uvoxamine, milnacipran, mirtazapine, paroxetine, reboxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine. The main outcomes were the proportion of patients who responded to or dropped out of the allocated treatment. Analysis was done on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nFindings Mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine, and sertraline were signifi  cantly more e/uniFB03 cacious than duloxetine (odds  ratios  [OR]  1\u00b739,  1\u00b733,  1\u00b730  and  1\u00b727,  respectively),  fl  uoxetine  (1\u00b737,  1\u00b732,  1\u00b728,  and  1\u00b725,  respectively), fl  uvoxamine  (1\u00b741,  1\u00b735,  1\u00b730,  and  1\u00b727,  respectively),  paroxetine  (1\u00b735,  1\u00b730,  1\u00b727,  and  1\u00b722,  respectively),  and reboxetine (2\u00b703, 1\u00b795, 1\u00b789, and 1\u00b785, respectively). Reboxetine was signifi  cantly less e/uniFB03 cacious than all the other antidepressants tested. Escitalopram and sertraline showed the best profi  le of acceptability, leading to signifi  cantly fewer discontinuations than did duloxetine, fl  uvoxamine, paroxetine, reboxetine, and venlafaxine.\n\nInterpretation Clinically important di/uniFB00  erences exist between commonly prescribed antidepressants for both e/uniFB03 cacy and acceptability in favour of escitalopram and sertraline. Sertraline might be the best choice when starting treatment for  moderate  to  severe  major  depression  in  adults  because  it  has  the  most  favourable  balance  between  benefi  ts, acceptability, and acquisition cost.\n\nFunding None.",

The network of eligible comparisons for acceptability (dropout rate) analysis is similar.\n\nwith  a  validated  imputation  method. 16 Responders  to treatment  were  calculated  on  an  intention-to-treat basis:  the  analysis  was  based  on  the  total  number  of randomly  assigned  participants,  irrespective  of  how the  original  study  investigators  analysed  the  data.  To carry out a clinically sound  analysis,  we  used  a conservative approach and imputed outcomes for the missing participants assuming  that they did not respond to treatment.\n\nFirst, we did pair-wise meta-analyses by synthesising 17 studies  that  compared  the  same  interventions  with  a random-e/uniFB00  ects  model 18 to  incorporate  the  assumption that  di/uniFB00  erent  studies  assessed  di/uniFB00  erent,  yet  related, treatment  e/uniFB00  ects. 17 We  used  visual  inspection  of  the forest  plots  to  investigate  the  possibility  of  statistical heterogeneity, and the I 2 statistic. 19 We did the analyses using Stata version 9.\n\nSecond,  we  did  a  random-e/uniFB00  ects  model  within  a Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in WinBUGS (MRC Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge, UK). 11 We modelled the binary outcomes in every treatment group of every study, and specifi  ed the relations  among  the  odds  ratios  (ORs)  across  studies making di/uniFB00  erent comparisons. 10 This method combines direct  and  indirect  evidence  for  any  given  pair  of treatments.  We  used  p  values  less  than  0\u00b705  and 95% CIs (according to whether the CI included the null value) to assess signifi  cance, and looked at a plausible range for the magnitude of the population di/uniFB00  erence. 20 We also assessed the probability that each antidepressant drug was the most e/uniFB03 cacious regimen, the second best, the third best, and so on, by calculating the OR for each drug  compared  with  an  arbitrary  common  control group, and counting the proportion of iterations of the Markov chain in which each drug had the highest OR, the second highest, and so on. We ranked treatments in terms of acceptability with the same methods.\n\nA key assumption behind multiple-treatments metaanalysis  is  that  the  analysed  network  is  coherent-ie, that direct and indirect evidence on the same comparisons do not disagree beyond chance. To estimate  incoherence,  we  calculated  the  ratio  of  odds ratios  for  indirect  versus  direct  evidence  whenever indirect  estimates  could  be  constructed  with  a  single common  comparator.  We  defi  ned  incoherence  as  the disagreement between direct and indirect evidence with a 95% CI excluding 1.\n\nFinally, we looked at comparative e/uniFB03 cacy among the 12  antidepressant  drugs.  We  expressed  these  using fl   uoxetine  as  reference  drug,  because  it  was  the  fi  rst among  these  12  antidepressants  to  be  marketed  in Europe and the USA, and it has been consistently used as reference drug among the di/uniFB00  erent pair-wise comparisons.\n\nWe did sensitivity analyses according to the following variables: dose (including only studies within the therapeutic  range)  and  imputation  (including  only studies without imputation). To investigate the e/uniFB00  ect of sponsorship  on  outcome  estimate,  we  carried  out  a meta-regression analysis.",

Most trials were rated as unclear  according  to  our  quality  assessment  and  only 12 were rated as adequate. Figure 2 shows the network of eligible comparisons for the multiple-treatments meta-analysis. Of the 66 possible pair-wise comparisons between the 12 treatments, 42 have been studied directly in one or more trials for e/uniFB03 cacy and 41 for acceptability.\n\nWe did direct comparisons (table 3), showing that e/uniFB03 cacy favours  escitalopram  over  citalopram;  citalopram  over reboxetine  and  paroxetine;  mirtazapine  over  fl  uoxetine and venlafaxine; sertraline over fl  uoxetine; and venlafaxine over fl  uoxetine and fl  uvoxamine. These results arise from 42 independent analyses without adjustment for multiple testing (ie, about two CIs would be expected to exclude 1 by chance alone). For dropouts, fl  uoxetine was better tolerated than reboxetine, and citalopram than sertraline.\n\nOverall, heterogeneity was moderate, although for most comparisons  the  95%  CI  included  values  that  showed very high  or no  heterogeneity, refl  ecting the  small number of included studies for each pair-wise comparison. In the meta-analyses of direct comparisons, we found I 2 values higher than 75% for the comparisons citalopram and reboxetine ( I 2 =85\u00b70%), and escitalopram and fl  uoxetine ( I 2 =82\u00b77%). In both cases, only two studies were included in the meta-analysis.\n\nFigure  3  summarises  the  results  of  the  multipletreatments  meta-analysis.  Escitalopram,  mirtazapine, sertraline, and  venlafaxine were  signifi  cantly  more e/uniFB03 cacious  than  duloxetine,  fl  uoxetine, fl   uvoxamine, paroxetine,  and  reboxetine  (even  though  less  clear benefi  ts were noted with sertraline than with escitalopram, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine when comparing with duloxetine  and  fl  uvoxamine,  with  the credibility interval for OR  slightly more than 1). Reboxetine was signifi  cantly less e/uniFB03 cacious than all the other  11  antidepressants.  These  fi  ndings  arise  from 66 simultaneous comparisons and about three statistically  signifi  cant  fi  ndings  might  be  expected  by chance alone. In terms of acceptability, duloxetine and paroxetine  were  less  well  tolerated  than  escitalopram and  sertraline;  fl  uvoxamine  less  well  tolerated  than citalopram,  escitalopram,  and  sertraline;  venlafaxine less  well  tolerated  than  escitalopram;  reboxetine  less well tolerated than many other antidepressants, such as bupropion,  citalopram,  escitalopram,  fl  uoxetine,  and sertraline; and escitalopram and sertraline were better tolerated than duloxetine, fl  uvoxamine, paroxetine, and reboxetine (fi  gure 3).\n\nMirtazapine,  escitalopram,  venlafaxine,  and  sertraline

Results are the ORs in the column-defi  ning treatment compared with the ORs in the row-defi  ning treatment. For effi cacy, ORs higher than 1 favour the column-defi  ning treatment (ie, the fi  rst in alphabetical order). For acceptability, ORs lower than 1 favour the fi  rst drug in alphabetical order. To obtain ORs for comparisons in the opposite direction, reciprocals should be taken (eg, the OR for FLU compared with CIT is 1/1\u00b710=0\u00b791).

Data  extraction and data entering were correct, and we could not identify any important variable that di/uniFB00  ered across comparisons in those loops; however, the number of included studies was small.\n\nExclusion of studies with any treatment dosage outside the defi  ned therapeutic range and without imputed data resulted in 109 and 90 trials, respectively. The multiple-treatments  meta-analysis  model  was  refi  tted accordingly  and  no  di/uniFB00  erences  in  conclusions  were observed in either set of ORs.\n\nFigure 4 shows the distribution of probabilities of each treatment being ranked at each of the possible 12 positions. Mirtazapine,  escitalopram,  venlafaxine, and  sertraline were among the most e/uniFB03 cacious treatments, and escitalopram, sertraline, bupropion, and citalopram were better tolerated than the other remaining antidepressants (fi  gure  4).  The  cumulative  probabilities  of  being  among the  four  most  e/uniFB03 cacious treatments  were:  mirtazapine (24\u00b74%), escitalopram (23\u00b77%), venlafaxine (22\u00b73%), sertraline (20\u00b73%), citalopram (3\u00b74%), milnacipran (2\u00b77%), bupropion (2\u00b70%), duloxetine (0\u00b79%), fl  uvoxamine (0\u00b77%), paroxetine (0\u00b71%), fl  uoxetine (0\u00b70%), and reboxetine (0\u00b70%). The cumulative probabilities of being among the four best treatments in terms of acceptability were: escitalopram (27\u00b76%), sertraline (21\u00b73%), bupropion (19\u00b73%), citalopram (18\u00b77%), milnacipran (7\u00b71%), mirtazapine (4\u00b74%), fl  uoxetine (3\u00b74%), venlafaxine (0\u00b79%), duloxetine (0\u00b77%), fl  uvoxamine (0\u00b74%), paroxetine (0\u00b72%), and reboxetine (0\u00b71%).\n\nIn  a  meta-regression  analysis  to  assess  potential sponsorship  bias,  ORs  and  fi  nal  rankings  did  not substantially  change.  The  cumulative  probability  of being among the four best treatments became slightly smaller for those drugs in trials which were sponsored by  the  marketing  company,  with  the  comparators moving up the ranking slightly.",

Our  fi  ndings  might help  to  choose  among  new-generation  antidepressants for acute treatment of major depression. Some antidepressants di/uniFB00  ered  both  statistically  and  clinically. In terms of response, mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine,  and  sertraline  were  more  e/uniFB03 cacious  than duloxetine, fl  uoxetine, fl  uvoxamine, paroxetine, and reboxetine. In terms of acceptability, escitalopram, sertraline, citalopram, and bupropion were better tolerated  than  other  new-generation  antidepressants. These  results  indicate  that  two  of  the  most  e/uniFB03 cacious treatments (mirtazapine and venlafaxine) might not be the best for overall acceptability.\n\nHere, we did not investigate important outcomes, such as  side-e/uniFB00  ects,  toxic  e/uniFB00  ects,  discontinuation  symptoms, and  social  functioning.  However,  the  most  important clinical implication of the results is that escitalopram and sertr  aline  might  be  the  best  choice  when  starting  a treatment for moderate to severe major depression because  they  have  the  best  possible  balance  between e/uniFB03 cacy and acceptability.\n\nWe  did  not  do  a  formal  cost-e/uniFB00  ectiveness  analysis; however, because some new anti  depressants are now o/uniFB00 patent  and  available  in  generic  form,  their  acquisition cost is reduced. Indeed, only two of the 12 antidepressants (escitalopram  and  duloxetine)  are  still  on  patent  in  the USA and in Europe. Sertraline seems to be better than escitalo  pram because of its lower cost in most countries. How  ever, in the absence of a full economic model, this recom  mendation cannot be made unequivocally because several other costs are associated with the use of antidepressants. 138\n\nReboxetine,  fl  uvoxamine,  paroxetine,  and  duloxetine were the least e/uniFB03 cacious and acceptable drugs, making them less favour  able options when prescribing an acute treat  ment for major depression. Furthermore, in terms of acceptability,  reboxetine  was  the  least  tolerated  agent among the 12 anti  depressants and was signifi  cantly less e/uniFB00  ective than all the other 11 drugs. Therefore, reboxetine should not be used as a routine fi  rst-line acute treatment for major depression.\n\nFindings from this analysis apply only to acute-phase treatment  (8  weeks)  of  depression.  Clinicians  need  to\n\nFigure 4: Ranking for effi cacy (solid line) and acceptability (dotted line) Ranking indicates the probability to be the best treatment, the second best, the third best, and so on, among the 12 antidepressants.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nknow  whether  (and  to  what  extent)  treatments  work within a clinically reasonable period. Clinically, the assessment of e/uniFB03 cacy after 6 weeks of treatment or after 16-24 weeks or more might lead to wide di/uniFB00  erences in treatment  outcome.  In  many  systematic  reviews,  the ability  to  provide  valid  estimates  of  treatment  e/uniFB00  ect  is limited because trials with di/uniFB00  erent durations of follow-up have been combined. 139 A systematic review of clinical-trial data 140 that investigated early response to antidepressants employed a common defi  nition of early response across all  included studies. Apart from this study, however, no systematic review has investigated the comparative e/uniFB03 cacy  of  antidepressants  in  individuals  with  major depression  employing  a  common  defi  nition  of  acute response that includes a predefi  ned follow-up duration.\n\nMost  trials  included  in  our  analysis  did  not  report adequate information about randomisation and allocation concealment,  and  this  might  undermine  the  validity  of overall  fi  ndings.  Nonetheless,  all  studies  on  antidepressants included in this meta-analysis were very similar in terms of design and conduct, and the scant information in terms of quality assessment could be more an issue of reporting in the text than real defects in study design, as it has been commonly found in other systematic reviews. 141\n\nEvidence exists of presence of sponsorship bias (ie, the bias associated with the commercial interests of industrial sponsors) in medicine, 142 and there is concern about the potential e/uniFB00  ect of fi  nancial interests on medical publications. Because most studies comparing the newest antidepressants (mirtazapine, escitalopram, buproprion, and duloxetine) were done by the pharmaceutical companies marketing these compounds, this  might  be  a  source  of  bias. 143 Some  discrepancies existed between some of the results of the multiple-treatments meta-analysis and  those in the direct  comparisons  (escitalopram vs citalopram  and mirtazapine vs venlafaxine). These fi  ndings emphasise a potential  advantage  of  this  analysis  that  incorporates indirect and direct comparisons, decreasing the risk for possible  sponsorship  bias.  However,  limitations  of  the primary trials and potential confounders (such as dose issues)  can  a/uniFB00  ect  the  validity  of  the  fi  ndings.  Readers cannot fully appreciate the meaning of a study without acknowledging the biases in the design and interpretation that can arise when a sponsor might benefi  t from a study publication. 144 Such associations should be made clear to let anyone judge the relevance of fi  ndings.\n\nPlacebo-controlled  trials  are  required  to  adequately assess  the  e/uniFB03 cacy  of  novel  antidepressant  drugs. 145 In both the USA and Europe, regulatory authorities require placebo-controlled  studies  for  marketing  authorisation. The selective publication of placebo-controlled antidepressant trials and its e/uniFB00  ect on apparent e/uniFB03 cacy is well  recognised 146 and  there  is  currently  controversy  on this topic 147 Placebo-controlled trials are mainly designed for  regulatory  approval  purposes;  to  meet  both  ethical and  safety  requirements,  they  tend  to  recruit  patients with a mild form of disease. 148 Although placebo-controlled trials can be e/uniFB03 cient because they need smaller sample sizes  than  non-placebo-controlled  trials,  di/uniFB03 culties  in carrying  out  these  trials  when  e/uniFB00  ective  treatments  are known  to  exist  can  introduce  artifacts into clinical trials. 149\n\nResponse  to  placebo  across  antidepressant  trials  has been shown to vary and has clearly increased in the past two  decades,  with  a  similar  increase  occurring  in  the fraction  of  patients  responding  to  active  medication  as well. 150 The issue of changes in trial outcomes over time is still  under  debate; 151 however,  the  change  in  placebo response does not seem to be directly explained by changes in study characteristics. 150 Infl  ation of baseline severity, for example, is likely to be a cause for the temporal rise in placebo response rates, which increases the proportion of failed  trials. 150 As  placebo-controlled  trials  of  antidepressants become increasingly di/uniFB03 cult to do, it is perhaps time to reconsider the standard requirements. Our analysis suggests that sertraline is better than other new-generation drugs in terms of e/uniFB03 cacy and acceptability, and could be used as a standard comparator in phase III and also in pragmatic (or e/uniFB00  ectiveness) trials to increase the real-world applicability  of  the  results.  Although  the  sample-size requirements might be larger than in the ideal placebo-controlled trial, the increased real-world applicability  of  the  results  would,  in  our  opinion,  o/uniFB00  set this disadvantage. Furthermore, the need of new treatments to show either greater e/uniFB03 cacy or acceptability than  an  existing  standard  therapy  would  serve  as  a disincentive  to  the  development  of  me-too  agents  that o/uniFB00  er little to patients other than increased costs.",
